The goal of `{leaf.magick}` is to overcome the somewhat outdated "Font Awesome" implementation in vanilla R `{leaflet}` by constructing markers on the fly using `{fontawesome}` and `{magick}`. There are three issues `{leaf.magick}` sets out to overcome:

* `leaflet::awesomeIcons()` is limited to Font Awesome 4 ðŸ‘Ž

* `leaflet::awesomeIcons()` is limited to a handful of discrete colours ðŸ‘Ž

* `leaflet::awesomeIcons()` is limited to a single marker size ðŸ‘Ž

* Vanilla `{leaflet}` doesn't provide any additional features to construct legends, icon palettes, or such like ðŸ‘Ž

`{leaf.magick}` attempts to solve all of this:

* `magicIcons()` uses up-to-date versions of Font Awesome and Boostrap Icons, powered by `{fontawesome}` and `{bsicons}` âœ…

* `magicIcons()` uses `{fontawesome}` to grab a marker shape, and can therefore colour and resize it however the user desires âœ…

* `{leaf.magick}` exports functions like `addIconLegend()` to help developers communicate the meanings of icons to users âœ…

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{leaf.magick}` like so:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("jack-davison/leaf.magick")
```
